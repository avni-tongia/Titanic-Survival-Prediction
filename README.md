# Titanic Classification Model

Implements a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on the famous Titanic dataset.

## Contents

1. **Introduction**  
   - The project aims to build a classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, sex, passenger class, etc.

2. **Dataset**  
   - The dataset is the Titanic dataset, commonly used for machine learning classification tasks. It is available on platforms like [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).

3. **Project Workflow**  
   - **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset and examining its structure.
   - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and understanding patterns in the data.
   - **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical values.
   - **Model Building**: Training a machine learning classification model (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, etc.).
   - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - **Visualization**: Presenting results through visual tools to analyze feature importance and model behavior.

4. **Requirements**  
   - Python 3.x
   - Libraries:
     - pandas
     - numpy
     - matplotlib
     - seaborn
     - scikit-learn

   Install the required packages using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
